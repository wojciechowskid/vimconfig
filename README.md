# vimconfig
A repository for my vimrc

Vim 7.4 introduced a new, very useful, scheme: it looks for the usual `~/.vimrc` and also for `~/.vim/vimrc`.
1. So to install `vimrc` from this repository, go to `~/.vim` and clone the contents of this repository `git clone https://github.com/wojciechowskid/vimconfig.git .` (note "." at the end)
2. Install `Vundle` according to its documentation and run `:PluginInstall` in VIM.
3. Install `YouCompleteMe` according to its documentation (go to bundles/YouCompleteMe and run ./install.sh -- https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe)
4. Install `Tern for Vim`: https://github.com/marijnh/tern_for_vim
