# vimconfig
A repository for my vimrc

Vim 7.4 introduced a new, very useful, scheme: it looks for the usual `~/.vimrc` and also for `~/.vim/vimrc`.
So to install `vimrc` from this repository, go to `~/.vim` and clone the contents of this repository `git clone https://github.com/wojciechowskid/vimconfig.git .` (note "." at the end)

Install `Vundle` according to its documentation and run `:PluginInstall` in VIM.
